## Step 2 - Calibrate
Before taking a measurement, you must calibrate it on a known area of the image by pressing the "Calibrate" button and by drowing the rectangle of the known component. In this example, you can select an HBM, which is estimated to be 110mm² (value given for example purposes only, not representative of the actual size).

## Step 3 - Change calibration
You can change the calibration value at any time by modifying the value in "Calib. area". You can also recalibrate on another surface at any time—your measurements will all be recalculated automatically.

Press the "Measure" button and draw a rectangle around the area you want to measure. You can improve the accuracy of your measurement by zooming in with your mouse wheel or by pressing the zoom in/out buttons. You can also move around the image by pressing the "Move" button.
